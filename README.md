various ESP PWM code and instructions to get ledcsetup to work

HAd trouble with ledcsetup not recognized, here is the discussion with GEMINI:
It sounds like you're running into a common compilation issue with your ESP32 setup! The error "LEDCSETUP NOT DECLARED IN THIS SCOPE" typically indicates that the Arduino IDE or your compiler environment isn't properly recognizing the ESP32's peripheral functions, like those used for PWM (LEDC).

This usually happens for one of these reasons:

Missing or Outdated ESP32 Board Definitions: The ledcSetup, ledcAttachPin, and ledcWrite functions are part of the ESP32's core Arduino library. If these definitions aren't installed or are outdated, the compiler won't find them.
Solution: Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager... in your Arduino IDE. Search for "ESP32" and ensure that "esp32 by Espressif Systems" is installed and up to date (the latest stable version is usually best).
Incorrect Board Selection: Even if the definitions are installed, you need to explicitly select an ESP32 board (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module," "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1") under Tools > Board in the Arduino IDE.
Solution: Double-check that you have the correct ESP32 board selected for your specific board.
Corrupted Installation: Less common, but sometimes a corrupted Arduino IDE or ESP32 package installation can cause such errors.
Solution: Try reinstalling the ESP32 board definitions, or even the Arduino IDE itself, if the above steps don't work.
The code in the Canvas document itself is correct for using the ESP32's LEDC peripheral, so no changes are needed there. Once your Arduino IDE environment is correctly set up for ESP32 development, this code should compile and upload without issues.






ME:
STILL GET LEDCSETUP ERROR AFTER uninstalling and reinstalling ESP32 lib v 3.2.0 and selecting DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT board. AND the json in preferences is correct.

Then closed and restarted IDE and got "need to update libraries". We will see if that helps. As i recall, we had to go to Appdata>Arduino15 and make it "OLD" then restart IDE to rebuild all the libraries. and it worked.

You're right to be persistent with that error! It's frustrating when the standard fixes don't work. The "LEDCSETUP NOT DECLARED" error strongly points to the Arduino IDE not properly finding or loading the ESP32 core libraries, even if you've reinstalled them.

Your recall about renaming the Arduino15 folder is an excellent and often necessary step for these kinds of persistent issues. This Arduino15 folder is where the Arduino IDE stores all its downloaded core files, libraries, and board definitions. Sometimes, these files can become corrupted, or the IDE gets confused about which versions to use. Renaming it forces the IDE to recreate this folder from scratch and re-download everything cleanly.

Here's a breakdown of why that usually works and how to do it:

Why it works:

Clean Slate: It completely removes all cached board definitions, libraries, and build data that the IDE might be holding onto, regardless of recent installations.
Forces Re-download: When you restart the IDE, it finds that the Arduino15 folder is missing and is forced to re-download the core files for any selected boards and libraries from scratch, ensuring you get fresh, uncorrupted versions.
Steps to perform the "Arduino15 OLD" trick:

Close the Arduino IDE completely. Make sure no instances are running.
Navigate to the Arduino15 folder:
Windows: Go to C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Arduino15
(Note: AppData is a hidden folder. You might need to enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in File Explorer's "View" options.)
macOS: ~/Library/Arduino15
Linux: ~/.arduino15
Rename the folder: Rename Arduino15 to something like Arduino15_OLD (or Arduino15_BACKUP). This ensures you have a backup in case you need to revert.
Restart the Arduino IDE.
Reinstall ESP32 Board Definitions: Go to File > Preferences, add the ESP32 board manager URL (if it's not already there): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., search for "ESP32" and install the latest version.
Select Your Board: Go to Tools > Board and select your "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1" or whatever specific ESP32 board you are using.
After these steps, your Arduino IDE should have a completely fresh installation of the ESP32 core, and the ledcSetup and other related functions should be recognized. The code in the Canvas document is standard ESP32 Arduino, so it should compile fine once your environment is set up correctly.
